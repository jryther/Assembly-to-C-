# Assembly-to-Cpp
Convert Assembly to C++

**Overview**
In previous activities, you have converted C++ code into assembly code. In this activity, you will reverse the process and demonstrate your ability to convert assembly code into C++ code. You will complete and submit the Assembly to C++ Activity Template Word Document.

**Prompt**
For this activity, you will analyze three examples of assembly code. For each example of assembly code, you must address the following rubric criteria:

Convert the assembly code into C++ code.
Use the Assembly to C++ Activity Template to complete this step.
Explain the functionality of the converted C++ code.
Use the Assembly to C++ Activity Template to complete this step.
Consider which blocks of assembly code are skeleton code versus actual parts from the C++ program.
